Ted,

Remember, I hid this stash for you to find. Don't trust anybody, especially anybody who works for me. Do this alone.

I busted the storage door, down near the service entrance.

There's a floor safe in the Clinic that contains the parts to fix the broken door. I also left you a repair manual, just in case you've gotten rusty, but you were always a wizard with a wrench, so I'm sure you'll be fine. Now get going.
